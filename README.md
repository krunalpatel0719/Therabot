Dependencies: <br />
Node.js: Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and follow instructions on the website. <br />
In terminal in the project folder, run the command "yarn install" and when that is done, run yarn start and it should start the local server. <br />
If that does not work, do the same thing but replace yarn with npm in both instances.
